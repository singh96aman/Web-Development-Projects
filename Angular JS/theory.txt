AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It is a library written in JavaScript.

AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file, and can be added to a web page with a script tag:

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js" />

AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.

The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view. 

The ng-app directive defines the application, the ng-controller directive defines the controller.

Like JavaScript expressions, AngularJS expressions can contain literals, operators, and variables.

Unlike JavaScript expressions, AngularJS expressions can be written inside HTML.

AngularJS expressions do not support conditionals, loops, and exceptions, while JavaScript expressions do.

AngularJS expressions support filters, while JavaScript expressions do not.

The ng-app directive defines the root element of an AngularJS application.

The ng-init directive defines initial values for an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

The ng-controller directive defines the application controller.

A controller is a JavaScript Object, created by a standard JavaScript object constructor.

All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element that contains the ng-app directive.

In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, your AngularJS application.

$http is an AngularJS service for reading data from remote servers.

JSON is a great way of transporting data, and it is easy to use within AngularJS, or any other JavaScript.

You can add AngularJS event listeners to your HTML elements by using one or more of these directives:

    ng-blur
    ng-change
    ng-click
    ng-copy
    ng-cut
    ng-dblclick
    ng-focus
    ng-keydown
    ng-keypress
    ng-keyup
    ng-mousedown
    ng-mouseenter
    ng-mouseleave
    ng-mousemove
